# Contributing to Loud

Want to help? Great! The following is a set of guidelines for
contributing.

## Branch for Pull Requests

`master`

## How to help?

 * Generate new **ideas** and particiate in discussion
 * Improve **documentation**
 * Fix typos and clarify language, keep content easy to read
 * **Find and report** bugs, fix them

## Reporting Issues

### Bugs

**Check if someone has already reported the issue**.
If it does, add a “+1” or “I have this problem too”.
This helps decide on priorities.

If nothing found, create an issue and report:

 * What’s happening and your expectation
 * Steps to reproduce
 * Your environment (OS, browsers)
 * What would you expect to be the outcome?

Be as detailed as possible.

### New features

**Ask before starting a significant contribution**, like new features.
You risk waste a lot of time working on something useless.

Create an issue and describe your thoughts in English first.

### Questions

Please, don’t create issues for asking questions,
use [StackOverflow][] instead.

## Testing Changes

Please, submit tests for your contribution.

Try to keep code coverage at 100%.

## Following Conventions

### Code Style

Follow the [EditorConfig][] rules placed in the `.editorconfig` file:

 * Indentation: 4 spaces
 * End of line: LF (Unix)
 * Recommended line length limit: 72 characters

JavaScript code style is as follow:

 * Single-quoted strings
 * Whitespace after reserved words, between operators, after comma
 * Declare variables at the beginning of functions
 * Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`

Please, follow coding conventions already used in the edited file even
if these conventions contradict the rules above.

### Commit message

Please, make commits of logical units and describe them properly.

 * Write in plain English.
 * Explain the issue, not the actions
 * Use the present tense (“Fix an issue”, not “Fixed an issue”)
 * Use the imperative mood (“Fix an issue”, not “Fixes an issue”)
 * On the first line, line length limit is 50 characters;
   don’t place a dot at the end of the line
 * Second line is blank
 * On the next lines, line length limit is 72 characters

### Documentation

Write documentation in [plain English][].

Avoid:

 * Passive voice
 * Weasel words
 * Lexical illusions (cases of word repeatition)
 * Cliches
 * “So”, “there is” or “there are” at the beginning of the sentence
 * Placing dots, commas or semicolons at the end of the list item

Write a friendly documentation for all, regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or
similar personal characteristic.
